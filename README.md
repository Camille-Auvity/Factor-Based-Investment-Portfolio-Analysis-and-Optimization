# Factor-Based Investment Portfolio Analysis and Optimization
Replicate the results of Dichtl et al. (2021) by constructing six factors (MKT, VAL, CAP, MOM, QUA, VOL) using MSCI USA indices, then optimizing portfolios through six allocation strategies. Performance is evaluated out-of-sample using financial metrics, and results are visualized.

# Investment Assignment 3: Factor Analysis and Portfolio Strategies
## Project Description
This repository contains the analysis and results of Assignment 3 from the Investment course. The project focuses on constructing investment factors, performing descriptive analysis of these factors, and comparing different portfolio strategies.

# Project Structure
## Part 1: Factor Construction and Descriptive Analysis

- Factors Built: MKT, VAL, CAP, MOM, QUA, VOL
- Statistical Analysis: Mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis for each factor.
- Correlation Matrix: Pearson correlations between factors.
- Plots: Cumulative returns of the factors.

## Part 2: Comparison of Portfolio Strategies

### Strategies Analyzed:

- Equal Weight Portfolio (EW)
- Minimum Variance Portfolio (MinVar)
- Mean-Variance Portfolio (MV)
- Black-Litterman Portfolio (BL)
- Volatility Timing Portfolio (VT)
- Reward-to-Risk Timing Portfolio (RRT)

## Part 3: Strategy Analysis

### Performance Metrics:

- Sharpe Ratio
- Downside Risk
- Sortino Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown (MDD)
- MPPM (Manipulation-Proof Performance Measure)

Plots: Cumulative returns and portfolio weights.

## Key Results

Factors: The MKT factor showed the highest volatility and extreme events, while QUA and VOL were more stable.
Strategies: MinVar and VT stood out for their low risk and stability, while MV and RRT showed higher volatility in pursuit of higher returns.
